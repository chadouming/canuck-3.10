* Qualcomm Video Processing Unit Subsystem Peripheral Image Loader

pil-vpu is a peripheral image loading (PIL) driver. It is used for loading
vpu firmware images for video processing into memory and preparing the subsystem's
processor to execute code. It is also used for shutting down the processor when
it's not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible: "pil-vpu"
- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
- reg-names: names of the bases for the above registers. "maple_csr_base".
- vdd-supply: regulator to supply vpu.
- qti,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image. Ex. "vpu"

Example:

	qti,vpu@fde0b000{
		compatible = "qti,pil-vpu";
		reg = <0xfde0b000 0x80>;
		reg-names = "maple_csr_base";
		vdd-supply = <&gdsc_vpu>;

		qti,firmware-name = "vpu";
	};
